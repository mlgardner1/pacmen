# PacMen Factory

## Description
This program utilizes buttons to create and run a PacMen factory game. The PacMen run at different velocities and are limited by the edges of the window. 
## Instructions
Pres the "Add PacMan" button to produce a PacMan, and repeat until you have created the desired number. Then, press "Start Game" to move the PacMen. Press "Start Game" again to change the images' velocity.
## Roadmap
I would like to experiment with changing the colors of the buttons and adding PacMen in set rows instead of randomly.
